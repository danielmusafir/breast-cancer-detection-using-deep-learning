# Breast-cancer-detection-using-deep-learning

**ABSTRACT**

Breast cancer is considered to be one of the leading causes of death among women aged 20-59 worldwide. Early detection and treatment may allow patients to receive appropriate treatment and thus reduce the risk of breast cancer. Studies show that most experienced physicians can diagnose cancer with 97% accuracy while 96% accurate diagnosis is obtained using deep learning techniques. In this paper, we present the most recent models of breast cancer screening and classification models based on machine learning by analyzing them in the form of comparative research. Also, in this paper, sets of public data to be used and popular and to be listed in the latest activity to facilitate any new tests and comparisons. Challenge dataset of histology images of breast cancer and achieve a high classification accuracy of 72%. Experimental results show that our method can achieve quite promising performance and outperform state-of-the-art methods in the coming days.
